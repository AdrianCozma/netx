 * <p>
 * {@link URLStreamHandlerFactory} is a singleton that is registered using the 
 * static method 
 * {@link URL#setURLStreamHandlerFactory(URLStreamHandlerFactory)}. Also,
 * the {@link URL} objects can only be created for the following protocols:
 * -- http, https, file, ftp, and jar. In order to install protocol handlers 
 * for other protocols, one has to hijack or override the system's singleton 
 * {@link URLStreamHandlerFactory} instance with a custom implementation. The 
 * objective of this class is to make the {@link URLStreamHandler} registration
 * for other protocols such as ws, wss, etc. feasible without hijacking the 
 * system's {@link URLStreamHandlerFactory}.
